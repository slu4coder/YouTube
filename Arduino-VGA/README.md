# Arduino VGA Output

Output 320(or 400) x 200 pixels with an Arduino Nano using only 3 standard logic ICs. Use a terminal input register to write text data and ANSI escape sequences to this VGA terminal. Please note that this is *NOT* supporting a USART serial connection but a parallel connection to a CPU's 8-bit bus.

This is used for my video series about VGA output and my home-built minimalistic CPU.
